# Movie Genre Analysis
Author: Frank Fortunati

# Overview and Business Understanding
The company is looking to expand into the film industry and create its own film studio! I have been tasked to analyze which film genres and types are most successful currently. My challenge was to determine what types of movies and creative talent would be best for our new studio.

# Data Understanding
I utilized data sets from IMDB and OTHER DATA SOURCE to perform my analysis. The IMDB data was stored as a SQLIte database and contained information on average movie ratings, directors, actors, locations, runtimes, genres, and titles. OTHER DATA SOURCE contained the info on which studios produced which movies, how much gross revenue each title generated, and year of release.
